# Thunk
Everyone is making cute little cube timers [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Feilifan-Exercise-Management-Countdown-15-20-30-60/dp/B08PB9W3GT/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Cube+Timer&qid=1615395070&sr=8-2). There's an issue: they suck. The best attempt so far came from an indigogo campaign, [TickTime](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ticktime-countdown-manage-time-like-never-before#/), and even then was reported to feel light and plasticy. It also is unclear how to obtain a genuine copy, as multiple sources across the web appear to be selling them "unbranded". More professional attemps have been made that include more sides and fandangles, but also tie into propriatary apps and have a spotty record when it comes to fulfilment.

This project is an attempt to homebrew a sturdy, hackable version of this product type.
